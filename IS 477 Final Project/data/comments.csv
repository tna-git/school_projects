kyvb3x0,1c08w09,Don't forget that Disney owns Hulu so boycott them too  Edit: and ESPN,2024-04-10 02:56:05
kv5x740,1bg9err,"Given how the counter-productive actions of fans in the 80s and 90s really damaged the show's reputation, both in the media and among the BBC executives who were making the decisions, we need to be really careful about knee-jerk responses to unexpected news.  The show has a huge budget, the people I consider to be the best Who writers are back, and there is a huge marketing push to get it into mainstream consciousness.    But thanks to the awkwardness of the Earth's spin, we're either going to have to stay up late, or watch it in the morning after getting up, or avoid social media until the evening, or see some spoilers before we see the show.  Disney are putting the money up, it's entirely realistic that they would call the shots on this.  As you say, it is money which is listened to.  Some of us are old enough to have to wait *years* to see our favourite shows, with spoilers published in scifi magazines by thoughtless contributors, or sometimes passed on in person by acquaintances who had seen the show in question in the US.  We are actually in a really good position now of not having to wait years for shows, which then get edited-cut to shreds because every new broadcaster which receives the tapes employs a censor who needs to justify his salary somehow.  We now all see the same thing at the same time.",2024-03-16 17:26:51
kv6e8vl,1bg9err,"Just like Sesame Street needed a cofunding deal with HBO in order to survive after budget cuts at PBS, Doctor Who needed a cofunding deal with Disney in order the survive after budget cuts at the BBC.    All boycotting Disney would do is make them feel Doctor Who isn’t worth the hastle. Then they’d stop cofunding it, and we’d have another cancellation and decade+ hiatus.    If you don’t want more Doctor Who for a really, really long time, feel free to boycott them I guess.    Me? I’m just fucking happy the show’s continuing as TV and movie studios are slashing budgets and projects left and right. I’m worried as fuck for Star Trek right now.",2024-03-16 19:12:14
kv5uvdu,1bg9err,"Frankly, I have no interest in this. I'll watch the show when I choose to watch it. Why should I care if I'm not watching it """"live"""" with the UK?",2024-03-16 17:12:43
kv6pibp,1bg9err,"Russell T Davies gave a talk somewhere a few years ago, the video is on YouTube talking about BBC is going to die a slow, painful death eventually so it is not out of the ordinary for him to push streaming. I also feel like it should be mentioned that Doctor Who was canceled in the 80s partially for low viewership. Let's not motivate them to repeat history.",2024-03-16 20:23:47
kv5vy7c,1bg9err,"Why? What a silly thing to get so angry about. It's the way the show was going anyway, it's already marketed as streaming first and 70% of viewership is on the iplayer after broadcast anyway.",2024-03-16 17:19:20
kv5ut80,1bg9err,"People jumping straight to blaming Disney for everything as if the evil evil mouse is out there just beaning poor dear Auntie Beeb over the head with a sledgehammer over everything, instead of acknowledging that the BBC may have made a few damn decisions of their own, are making me very tired.",2024-03-16 17:12:21

kv65c13,1bg9err,"I'm no fan of the decision behind the airtime and and I'm a UK fan so I'm saying this next bit as one of the ones impacted:   I would really rather American fans weren't intentionally trying to damage the show's success and a big part of its current budget by refusing to buy D+ purely because of DW getting a prime time US release and midnight UK release.  I don't like the release schedule, but what I do like is the show doing well, having a healthy audience and potentially more funding based on its success.  I know having the show and having it do well is much more important to me than not having it at all because that's somehow better than an inconvenient time.",2024-03-16 18:16:54
kv5vj2p,1bg9err,I don't understand the problem? You want d+ to force Americans to wait? I literally don't get it.,2024-03-16 17:16:45

kv63cfu,1bg9err,The entire state of Florida which makes half of its revenue from the mouse couldn’t boycott Disney effectively. Do you really think that fans of an international sci-fi show can?,2024-03-16 18:04:35

kv6a98d,1bg9err,Just means a few more people will need to take precautions to avoid spoilers. Personally not seen an episode live since the 80s.,2024-03-16 18:47:25
kv5s959,1bg9err,"Nope, that's not going to work, for obvious reasons - Disney don't air the show in the UK, they aren't the ones deciding what time the BBC air it, and for those outside the UK, the BBC broadcast is not a legitimate option.  If you actually want to make a difference, complain. [Here](https://www.bbc.co.uk/contact/complaints/make-a-complaint) is how you can complain to the BBC.   Select """"TV"""", """"BBC One"""", """"No"""", then on the next page give """"Doctor Who"""" as the title, leave the optional fields blank, and choose """"scheduling"""" as your category. Then fill in the remaining details as you like, being sure to give accurate contact information (especially email).

kv6ochx,1bg9err,I thought Disney+ only carried Doctor Who outside the British Isles? Why/how could British fans boycott it when it's on iplayer anyway? Or is the idea the rest of the world should wait til the UK release time so you in Britain can avoid spoilers?,2024-03-16 20:16:23
kv66mas,1bg9err,"We can but I’m not going to. It’s my only choice and whilst it’s clear that a lot of people DO care about this, you’re majorly overestimating the viewing power of the people here who actually would boycott. Even you.

kv5ykex,1bg9err,Disney just has weird release times. In The US most of their popular shows start at 3am. A lot of people would just wake up to watch them and go back to bed.,2024-03-16 17:35:14

kv9endu,1bg9err,"I watch a few things that come on past midnight UK time. I tend to watch them when I get up in the morning or when I'm back from work the next day. It's really not a big deal.  Didn't even know the Doctor Who time had been set yet. I'm paying for Disney Plus for the shows on there and Doctor Who will be one of those as I want to avoid the license fee in the UK (personal bugbear with the conning gits) that you have to pay for iPlayer. I'll be watching it either when it airs or the next day.  You know what a boycott will do, if it's successful? It won't affect the show times as those will stay the same throughout the Disney deal. But if it's actually successful, it will cause Disney to pull out of the deal that's giving extra money to the show. That takes the budget (already only stretching to eight episode shows even with the influx of new money) back to the end days of Moffat and Chibnall levels. Possibly less, because the show has been boycotted by enough people to affect viewership and drive away a corporate partner. With less money the quality falls and the amount of episodes they can make falls and the whole thing spirals until the show is cancelled again. All because you don't want to stay up slightly late or wait until the next day to watch.",2024-03-17 09:58:30
kvd4m1k,1bg9err,"I'm not overly bothered about it appearing on iPlayer first, but midnight is late, especially for two episodes. 10pm or 11pm would be doable, as that's the time I usually watch TV. I certainly won't watch it in the morning, and afternoon TV would be sports if anything.  So I'll probably see it 22 hours later, unless I see spoilers on social media, in which case I'll probably skip it and watch something else.",2024-03-18 01:02:27
kvk3xmk,1bg9err,"As a gamer I can say that this sort of thing not only never has the desired impact, but often seems to have no effect at all. Either enough people do not participate or the story generates additional interest itself. *Hogwarts Legacy* really tanked, huh?  Not saying we should do this even were that not so, much as it seems a silly timing decision to me.  I don't really like the big budget stories, especially from Russell but understand the need for funding, and that this isn't such a bad arrangement given the apparent lack of creative meddling.  I do think it is inadvisable to chase the international money over the domestic market - that's a bit like what happened to kill the movie. Tanked in the US, well watched here.",2024-03-19 10:16:22
kv8gvfh,1bg9err,"Just because of this post, I'm going to create multiple accounts, have them all subscribe to Disney+ and then use those accounts on different devices to watch Doctor Who at the same time on Friday night.",2024-03-17 03:40:56
kv8u1q5,1bg9err,Man. Seriously. Go outside. Take a break. This is a nothing burger of an issue.   This is nothing new for streaming or television.  Minus that. It’s not hard to just wait a day or two to watch the episode. Whilst avoiding spoilers.,2024-03-17 05:43:23

Us fans in the US had to wait 8 hours no less than 2 years ago at least to watch the show and avoid spoilers.

Don't act as if it's okay to have political things in children's shows when they have no need for it because they're not adults. There's a reason why children can't vote until they're 18. There's a reason why children can't drink until they're 21. There's a reason why children are not supposed to have sex or watch p*** until they're 18. It's our responsibility as adults to keep children as innocent as possible and teach them the important ways of life. Let children explore and find out if they're gay on their own nobody needs to tell them, nobody needs to show them, people were plenty gay 40 years ago and even a thousand years ago without some TV show to show them.

Not necessrily debates about political  sides themself :) Disney is trying to be """"woke"""" now soooooo freaking bad that they have lost all the quality they had established with countless classics. Cuz today throwing in diversity purely for the sake of it is more important than quality.   Idk if character is black, lgbtq+, muslim etc. heck my fave disney characters are lion king simba and his daughter, pocahontas and mulan. Neither of them is my race, some not even my species 😅 i am not lesbian but i love Korasami (lesbian couple Kora and Asami in legend of Kora, not disney movie tho). It is interesting when characters have mental and physical dissabilities because it enriches the stories by showing us something new. I love learning about all kind's of religions too. So i don't mind any of it being present, in fact i think we need more movies that show these in meaningful way. For example yes, we don't have many black princesses, i think black people deserve proper representation and original new movies with black characters, not some cheap recoloring of established white character ;)   When diversity is forced for the sake of it, not really being meaningful to the story and NEITHER being just random characteristic, it ruins the movie. I want my kid to treat everyone equally. Minority or not, it doesn't matter, nobody is more important. It is nothing to make huge deal out of and to force everywhere and focus on it. Whether i am straight, lesbian, bi, whatever, that is just one thing about me. It is unrealistis and unsane to revolve my whole existance around it and demand everyone else to so the same. Also if my race (or my dissability for example) is not important, meaningful to the story, there is NO reason to focus the story on it.  For example you can make movie focusing on showing how blindness affect people and have meaningfully blind person, or you can have movie unrelated to blindness with coincidentally blind character where blindness is just one trait about them, that you are not focusing on to the point of overtaking story itself.  Disney (like many others) nowadays is trying too hard to forcefully add things just for sake of adding it. Also i don't need my kids to learn delusions for the same of somebody else not liking facts. Sure old disney movies are not perfect either (especially the ones including POC, like Aladdin, have quite some racism hidden in it. And disney is full of sexism) and it will already take effort for me to correct those and ensure my kid does not internalize it, i don't need my job even harder by some foolish wokeness/politic corectness 🙄 especially if it is so bad that there is not even a good story to make it worth watching (old ones at least had that).

Guess how quickly we had to learn how to fix toilets? We actually had to remove all 3 of them over the course of one weekend. I hate cocomelon.",2024-01-14 00:05:19
khpvsbn,195dvjg,I've seen how it affects younger kids. It's crazy.,2024-01-13 20:54:39
khmkf79,195dvjg,"Even my parents wouldn’t let my sister and I watch tv for a while if we were watching too much, so what you’re doing is totally normal, non-biased parenting.",2024-01-13 04:31:27
khr3lxt,195dvjg,"Okay, it makes you sad. I’m curious why you’re not answering the question though? Like, a handful of examples of stuff you’re okay with?",2024-01-14 01:27:49

khrgdts,195dvjg,Agreed! And I think “you can watch it if it’s on at a friends but at home you have Dreamworks” is a reasonable place to put the line in the sand.,2024-01-14 02:50:50
khq72sy,195dvjg,we just don't have it here and I'm sure AF not going to Disney. But she's seen that stuff at friend's houses. She does not feel deprived.,2024-01-13 22:03:58
khtp0lm,195dvjg,Do you want me to sit down in front of my kids' bookshelves and write down a list of books? It's such a bizarre question.  Stillwater is an example of a tv show for kids that's not franchised. Planet Earth. Ms. Rachel. We don't watch tv much so I can't think of many.,2024-01-14 15:34:09

khv7ivb,195dvjg,By contributing money to Israel's military forces. All of this is very easy to look up if you haven't seen anything about it since it started in October.,2024-01-14 20:55:01
khscw5z,195dvjg,Yeah exactly. And even houses that love Disney shouldn't feel obligated to bankrupt themselves by doing a Disney trip unless they can really afford it. The pressure is intense and unnecessary.,2024-01-14 07:28:09
khtu8hq,195dvjg,"I just for asked “a few examples” to understand better, I dunno why that’s a big chore that requires you to sit down and make a list. You surely know things your kids have and watch? Your reaction to someone merely asking more info on your comment is more bizarre, frankly.   Thanks for the info, sorry it caused a problem.",2024-01-14 16:07:19

khynuoc,195dvjg,"I remain confused as to how it’s hard to understand that I’m asking what YOUR kid is allowed to access after reading your comment. That’s it. You’ve done that now, so great!  You make a comment online, people will respond and sometimes ask for more info. I’m puzzled how this has saddened or offended you, but here we are!
