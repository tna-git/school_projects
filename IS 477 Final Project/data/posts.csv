1bg9err,We can boycott Disney for the decision of UK midnight release time,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/1bg9err/we_can_boycott_disney_for_the_decision_of_uk/,"Basically don't use Disney to watch Doctor Who, and they'll get the message. Companies don't listen to anything but money, so that is exactly what should be withheld.  Don't subscribe to Disney Plus for Doctor Who. Or if you already have it, at least don't watch Doctor Who on Friday night, watch it on Sunday with the UK live broadcast. Or even better don't watch Doctor Who on Disney at all, find it somewhere else.  This makes Disney's Friday viewing numbers lower so they know it's an awful release time, because we'd rather watch it all together with the live broadcast.",2024-03-16 16:03:52

195dvjg,Do you boycott Disney even if it’s not what your kids want?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskParents/comments/195dvjg/do_you_boycott_disney_even_if_its_not_what_your/,"I’m asking mostly because I’ve read things from people who claim to be parents, saying that they will never let their kids go to Disneyland or watch anything from Disney for political reasons.   But when I have kids, I’m not boycotting Disney.",2024-01-13 03:05:17
