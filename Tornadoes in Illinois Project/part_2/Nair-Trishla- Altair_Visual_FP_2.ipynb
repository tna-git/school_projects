Estimated winds of 210 MPH disintegrated mobile homes and levelled several modern frame homes. One frame house was swept clean off its foundation, with only the roof left intact in a creek about 200 yards away. Many vehicles were lifted, rolled, or thrown up to 100 yards or more. Numerous cases of missiling were observed, including glass embedded in trees. Tree destruction in forested areas was nearly complete, and a few trees were debarked. The only fatality in Massac County was a 65-year-old female who was killed when her mobile home disintegrated. The official cause of death was blunt trauma to the head. She was found in a water-filled ravine about 100 yards from the former site of her mobile home. The frame of the mobile home was wrapped around the trunks of two trees that were stripped of all their limbs. Most of the levelled frame homes were concentrated on Boaz Road and Rolling Hills Road, in or near Hillerman. After passing through Hillerman, the tornado overturned dozens of railroad cars of a train just west of the Mermet Lake Conservation Area, which is off U.S. Route 45. The Mermet Lake Conservation Area was extensively damaged. An estimated 300 acres of forest were destroyed, boat docks were destroyed, and bathing facilities were destroyed. Dozens of waterfowl were found dead. After destroying additional residences and high tension power lines, the tornado crossed Interstate 24 near mile marker 28, about a mile south of the New Columbia exit. Tractor-trailer rigs and a tour bus were overturned on the interstate, injuring the drivers. The interstate was closed due to grain bins, tree limbs, and some building debris on the highway. Additional residences were destroyed between the interstate and the Pope County line. The tornado crossed into Pope County near where Illinois Route 145 crosses the county line. In Massac County, a total of 15 single-family houses and 13 mobile homes were destroyed. About 20 other single-family houses and 15 mobile homes received major damage. Several dozen other residences had some type of minor damage. Numerous vehicles and farming implements were destroyed, including combines. About 20 persons were injured in Massac County, but only one or two were hospitalized in serious or critical condition. Most of the injuries involved lacerations, bruises, broken bones, and internal injuries.

An additional nine single-family homes and two mobile homes received major damage. Dozens of other residences received minor to moderate damage. Some vehicles were rolled or moved. The tornado passed just west and northwest of Golconda before ending about a mile north of town. Just west of Golconda, the roof was blown off the county elementary school's gymnasium.  Despite the seven destroyed residences, not one injury was reported. The maximum intensity of the tornado was rated F-3 in Pope County, and F-4 in Massac and Pulaski Counties. The slightly lower intensity of the tornado, combined with the fact it narrowly missed the center of several Pope County communities, may partly explain the lack of injuries.

The main line of thunderstorms had already moved east of the area when a small thunderstorm developed near Yorkville and quickly interacted with a lake breeze moving west through the same area.  This interaction helped to form a circulation which spun up as a weak tornado.  Numerous trees were damaged and some were blown down.  Damage occurred to several trailers and campers from the falling trees and tree limbs.  The tornado appeared to skip along the ground with the strongest winds staying aloft affecting mainly the trees.  The tornado lasted about two minutes.\", \"EPISODE_NARRATIVE\": \"A line of severe thunderstorms moved east across north central Illinois during the early afternoon hours of July 27th.  Additional thunderstorms developed ahead of the first line across the southern portions of the Chicago Metro area producing very heavy rain and widespread flooding.  As the first line of severe storms reached Lee county, numerous trees, tree limbs and power lines were blown down in Amboy in Lee county.  Trees were blown down onto houses in West Brooklyn, also in Lee county.  Winds as high as 65 mph blew down trees, large tree limbs and power lines across many locations in La Salle county.  Trees were blown down in La Salle.  Trees were uprooted near Lake Holiday in far northeast La Salle county.  Large tree limbs were blown down in Mendota, Norway and one mile east of Serena.  A grain bin was crushed and partially lifted off its base in Ottawa and a tree fell onto a car in Seatonville, both in LaSalle county.  Wind damage was widespread across Kendall county as well.  Trees, large tree limbs and power lines were blown down in Plano, Newark and Oswego as well as many rural parts of the county.  Trees were blown down blocking Illinois Route 71 west of Oswego.  Trees 20 inches in diameter were blown down southeast of Plano along Lynwood Drive.  Southwest of Plano, a large tree limb fell onto a roof and broke a skylight.  Winds gusted to 74 mph in Sandwich in De Kalb county, where numerous large trees were blown down or uprooted and a 20 inch diameter tree fell onto house.  Several trees and tents were blown down at an Antique show in Sandwich in DeKlab county where one person suffered a broken arm and another was hit in the head by a falling tent pole.  Canopies were also blown off of stores in Sandwich.  A two and a half foot diameter tree was snapped at its base in Morris in Grundy county.  A gust to 60 mph was reported in Naperville in Will county.  A one foot diameter tree was snapped in half on Winthrop Street, east of Larkin and north of Black Roads in Joliet.  Large tree limbs and power lines were blown down in Kankakee.  A tree fell onto power lines in Sheldon in Iroquois county.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the strong winds and wind damage, very heavy rain fell across much of Will and southern Cook counties.  Most of the rain fell in a two hour period with 5.00 inches reported in Shorewood, 4.90 inches at the National Weather Service office in Romeoville, 4.10 inches in Midlothian, 4.00 inches in Joliet, 3.56 inches in Orland Park, 3.50 inches in Plainfield and South Holland, and 2.05 inches in Plano in Kendall county.  Widespread street flooding was reported across all of north and central Will and southern Cook counties and many homes and businesses suffered water and flood damage.  Retention ponds were flooded and backing up into yards and streets in Plainfield in Will county.  Creeks were overflowing their banks in Midlothian in Cook county.  Several roads had two to four feet of standing water and were impassible, some roads were partially washed away.  Several cars were submerged at the intersection of Lagrange and Nebraska streets in Frankfort in Will county.  A Will county sheriff's car was destroyed when it pulled into a flooded subdivision and sank.  Several people had to be rescued from their cars after becoming trapped by flood waters in Frankfort, Lockport, Joliet, and Plainfield in Will county.  A creek bridge was washed away in Lockport township.  A man indirectly died from the flooding after walking into his flooded basement and being shocked because the water was in contact with electricity.  An alley between Illinois and Main Streets in Lemont in Cook county was partially washed away by fast flowing water.  100 homes and 13 businesses were flooded in Lemont.  Flood waters surrounded several buildings in Tinely Park.  A 15 foot berm was washed away in unicorpated Palos Township which caused massive street and basement flooding in the Sandberg Glen subdivision.

The long lived nature of the tornado was due to it riding along a warm front pushing through Putnam and La Salle counties.  Satellite imagery indicated a strengthening mesocyclone at 1625 CST (2225 Z) with the formation of a new line of feeder clouds into the supercell, and KDVN 88D velocity data showed a strengthening TVS signature by 1635 CST (2235 Z).\\r\\n\\tWitnesses reported a multiple vortex tornado just prior to its arrival in Granville.

The town was bisected by the half mile wide tornado with 12 buildings destroyed, 45 with major damage, and 26 with minor damage (mainly residential).  The Granville State National Bank lost its roof and Hopkins Elementary School lost the roof over the old gymnasium with damage in nearly all the classrooms.

Eight people died and seven were rescued from the basement of a turn of the century sandstone building at Clark and Church Streets. The tornado was approximately 250 yards wide at this point.

Estimated winds of 210 MPH disintegrated mobile homes and levelled several modern frame homes. One frame house was swept clean off its foundation, with only the roof left intact in a creek about 200 yards away. Many vehicles were lifted, rolled, or thrown up to 100 yards or more. Numerous cases of missiling were observed, including glass embedded in trees. Tree destruction in forested areas was nearly complete, and a few trees were debarked. The only fatality in Massac County was a 65-year-old female who was killed when her mobile home disintegrated. The official cause of death was blunt trauma to the head. She was found in a water-filled ravine about 100 yards from the former site of her mobile home. The frame of the mobile home was wrapped around the trunks of two trees that were stripped of all their limbs. Most of the levelled frame homes were concentrated on Boaz Road and Rolling Hills Road, in or near Hillerman. After passing through Hillerman, the tornado overturned dozens of railroad cars of a train just west of the Mermet Lake Conservation Area, which is off U.S. Route 45. The Mermet Lake Conservation Area was extensively damaged. An estimated 300 acres of forest were destroyed, boat docks were destroyed, and bathing facilities were destroyed. Dozens of waterfowl were found dead. After destroying additional residences and high tension power lines, the tornado crossed Interstate 24 near mile marker 28, about a mile south of the New Columbia exit. Tractor-trailer rigs and a tour bus were overturned on the interstate, injuring the drivers. The interstate was closed due to grain bins, tree limbs, and some building debris on the highway. Additional residences were destroyed between the interstate and the Pope County line. The tornado crossed into Pope County near where Illinois Route 145 crosses the county line. In Massac County, a total of 15 single-family houses and 13 mobile homes were destroyed. About 20 other single-family houses and 15 mobile homes received major damage. Several dozen other residences had some type of minor damage. Numerous vehicles and farming implements were destroyed, including combines. About 20 persons were injured in Massac County, but only one or two were hospitalized in serious or critical condition. Most of the injuries involved lacerations, bruises, broken bones, and internal injuries.

An additional nine single-family homes and two mobile homes received major damage. Dozens of other residences received minor to moderate damage. Some vehicles were rolled or moved. The tornado passed just west and northwest of Golconda before ending about a mile north of town. Just west of Golconda, the roof was blown off the county elementary school's gymnasium.  Despite the seven destroyed residences, not one injury was reported. The maximum intensity of the tornado was rated F-3 in Pope County, and F-4 in Massac and Pulaski Counties. The slightly lower intensity of the tornado, combined with the fact it narrowly missed the center of several Pope County communities, may partly explain the lack of injuries.

The main line of thunderstorms had already moved east of the area when a small thunderstorm developed near Yorkville and quickly interacted with a lake breeze moving west through the same area.  This interaction helped to form a circulation which spun up as a weak tornado.  Numerous trees were damaged and some were blown down.  Damage occurred to several trailers and campers from the falling trees and tree limbs.  The tornado appeared to skip along the ground with the strongest winds staying aloft affecting mainly the trees.  The tornado lasted about two minutes.\", \"EPISODE_NARRATIVE\": \"A line of severe thunderstorms moved east across north central Illinois during the early afternoon hours of July 27th.  Additional thunderstorms developed ahead of the first line across the southern portions of the Chicago Metro area producing very heavy rain and widespread flooding.  As the first line of severe storms reached Lee county, numerous trees, tree limbs and power lines were blown down in Amboy in Lee county.  Trees were blown down onto houses in West Brooklyn, also in Lee county.  Winds as high as 65 mph blew down trees, large tree limbs and power lines across many locations in La Salle county.  Trees were blown down in La Salle.  Trees were uprooted near Lake Holiday in far northeast La Salle county.  Large tree limbs were blown down in Mendota, Norway and one mile east of Serena.  A grain bin was crushed and partially lifted off its base in Ottawa and a tree fell onto a car in Seatonville, both in LaSalle county.  Wind damage was widespread across Kendall county as well.  Trees, large tree limbs and power lines were blown down in Plano, Newark and Oswego as well as many rural parts of the county.  Trees were blown down blocking Illinois Route 71 west of Oswego.  Trees 20 inches in diameter were blown down southeast of Plano along Lynwood Drive.  Southwest of Plano, a large tree limb fell onto a roof and broke a skylight.  Winds gusted to 74 mph in Sandwich in De Kalb county, where numerous large trees were blown down or uprooted and a 20 inch diameter tree fell onto house.  Several trees and tents were blown down at an Antique show in Sandwich in DeKlab county where one person suffered a broken arm and another was hit in the head by a falling tent pole.  Canopies were also blown off of stores in Sandwich.  A two and a half foot diameter tree was snapped at its base in Morris in Grundy county.  A gust to 60 mph was reported in Naperville in Will county.  A one foot diameter tree was snapped in half on Winthrop Street, east of Larkin and north of Black Roads in Joliet.  Large tree limbs and power lines were blown down in Kankakee.  A tree fell onto power lines in Sheldon in Iroquois county.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the strong winds and wind damage, very heavy rain fell across much of Will and southern Cook counties.  Most of the rain fell in a two hour period with 5.00 inches reported in Shorewood, 4.90 inches at the National Weather Service office in Romeoville, 4.10 inches in Midlothian, 4.00 inches in Joliet, 3.56 inches in Orland Park, 3.50 inches in Plainfield and South Holland, and 2.05 inches in Plano in Kendall county.  Widespread street flooding was reported across all of north and central Will and southern Cook counties and many homes and businesses suffered water and flood damage.  Retention ponds were flooded and backing up into yards and streets in Plainfield in Will county.  Creeks were overflowing their banks in Midlothian in Cook county.  Several roads had two to four feet of standing water and were impassible, some roads were partially washed away.  Several cars were submerged at the intersection of Lagrange and Nebraska streets in Frankfort in Will county.  A Will county sheriff's car was destroyed when it pulled into a flooded subdivision and sank.  Several people had to be rescued from their cars after becoming trapped by flood waters in Frankfort, Lockport, Joliet, and Plainfield in Will county.  A creek bridge was washed away in Lockport township.  A man indirectly died from the flooding after walking into his flooded basement and being shocked because the water was in contact with electricity.  An alley between Illinois and Main Streets in Lemont in Cook county was partially washed away by fast flowing water.  100 homes and 13 businesses were flooded in Lemont.  Flood waters surrounded several buildings in Tinely Park.  A 15 foot berm was washed away in unicorpated Palos Township which caused massive street and basement flooding in the Sandberg Glen subdivision.

The long lived nature of the tornado was due to it riding along a warm front pushing through Putnam and La Salle counties.  Satellite imagery indicated a strengthening mesocyclone at 1625 CST (2225 Z) with the formation of a new line of feeder clouds into the supercell, and KDVN 88D velocity data showed a strengthening TVS signature by 1635 CST (2235 Z).\\r\\n\\tWitnesses reported a multiple vortex tornado just prior to its arrival in Granville.

The town was bisected by the half mile wide tornado with 12 buildings destroyed, 45 with major damage, and 26 with minor damage (mainly residential).  The Granville State National Bank lost its roof and Hopkins Elementary School lost the roof over the old gymnasium with damage in nearly all the classrooms.

Eight people died and seven were rescued from the basement of a turn of the century sandstone building at Clark and Church Streets. The tornado was approximately 250 yards wide at this point.

Estimated winds of 210 MPH disintegrated mobile homes and levelled several modern frame homes. One frame house was swept clean off its foundation, with only the roof left intact in a creek about 200 yards away. Many vehicles were lifted, rolled, or thrown up to 100 yards or more. Numerous cases of missiling were observed, including glass embedded in trees. Tree destruction in forested areas was nearly complete, and a few trees were debarked. The only fatality in Massac County was a 65-year-old female who was killed when her mobile home disintegrated. The official cause of death was blunt trauma to the head. She was found in a water-filled ravine about 100 yards from the former site of her mobile home. The frame of the mobile home was wrapped around the trunks of two trees that were stripped of all their limbs. Most of the levelled frame homes were concentrated on Boaz Road and Rolling Hills Road, in or near Hillerman. After passing through Hillerman, the tornado overturned dozens of railroad cars of a train just west of the Mermet Lake Conservation Area, which is off U.S. Route 45. The Mermet Lake Conservation Area was extensively damaged. An estimated 300 acres of forest were destroyed, boat docks were destroyed, and bathing facilities were destroyed. Dozens of waterfowl were found dead. After destroying additional residences and high tension power lines, the tornado crossed Interstate 24 near mile marker 28, about a mile south of the New Columbia exit. Tractor-trailer rigs and a tour bus were overturned on the interstate, injuring the drivers. The interstate was closed due to grain bins, tree limbs, and some building debris on the highway. Additional residences were destroyed between the interstate and the Pope County line. The tornado crossed into Pope County near where Illinois Route 145 crosses the county line. In Massac County, a total of 15 single-family houses and 13 mobile homes were destroyed. About 20 other single-family houses and 15 mobile homes received major damage. Several dozen other residences had some type of minor damage. Numerous vehicles and farming implements were destroyed, including combines. About 20 persons were injured in Massac County, but only one or two were hospitalized in serious or critical condition. Most of the injuries involved lacerations, bruises, broken bones, and internal injuries.

An additional nine single-family homes and two mobile homes received major damage. Dozens of other residences received minor to moderate damage. Some vehicles were rolled or moved. The tornado passed just west and northwest of Golconda before ending about a mile north of town. Just west of Golconda, the roof was blown off the county elementary school's gymnasium.  Despite the seven destroyed residences, not one injury was reported. The maximum intensity of the tornado was rated F-3 in Pope County, and F-4 in Massac and Pulaski Counties. The slightly lower intensity of the tornado, combined with the fact it narrowly missed the center of several Pope County communities, may partly explain the lack of injuries.

The main line of thunderstorms had already moved east of the area when a small thunderstorm developed near Yorkville and quickly interacted with a lake breeze moving west through the same area.  This interaction helped to form a circulation which spun up as a weak tornado.  Numerous trees were damaged and some were blown down.  Damage occurred to several trailers and campers from the falling trees and tree limbs.  The tornado appeared to skip along the ground with the strongest winds staying aloft affecting mainly the trees.  The tornado lasted about two minutes.\", \"EPISODE_NARRATIVE\": \"A line of severe thunderstorms moved east across north central Illinois during the early afternoon hours of July 27th.  Additional thunderstorms developed ahead of the first line across the southern portions of the Chicago Metro area producing very heavy rain and widespread flooding.  As the first line of severe storms reached Lee county, numerous trees, tree limbs and power lines were blown down in Amboy in Lee county.  Trees were blown down onto houses in West Brooklyn, also in Lee county.  Winds as high as 65 mph blew down trees, large tree limbs and power lines across many locations in La Salle county.  Trees were blown down in La Salle.  Trees were uprooted near Lake Holiday in far northeast La Salle county.  Large tree limbs were blown down in Mendota, Norway and one mile east of Serena.  A grain bin was crushed and partially lifted off its base in Ottawa and a tree fell onto a car in Seatonville, both in LaSalle county.  Wind damage was widespread across Kendall county as well.  Trees, large tree limbs and power lines were blown down in Plano, Newark and Oswego as well as many rural parts of the county.  Trees were blown down blocking Illinois Route 71 west of Oswego.  Trees 20 inches in diameter were blown down southeast of Plano along Lynwood Drive.  Southwest of Plano, a large tree limb fell onto a roof and broke a skylight.  Winds gusted to 74 mph in Sandwich in De Kalb county, where numerous large trees were blown down or uprooted and a 20 inch diameter tree fell onto house.  Several trees and tents were blown down at an Antique show in Sandwich in DeKlab county where one person suffered a broken arm and another was hit in the head by a falling tent pole.  Canopies were also blown off of stores in Sandwich.  A two and a half foot diameter tree was snapped at its base in Morris in Grundy county.  A gust to 60 mph was reported in Naperville in Will county.  A one foot diameter tree was snapped in half on Winthrop Street, east of Larkin and north of Black Roads in Joliet.  Large tree limbs and power lines were blown down in Kankakee.  A tree fell onto power lines in Sheldon in Iroquois county.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the strong winds and wind damage, very heavy rain fell across much of Will and southern Cook counties.  Most of the rain fell in a two hour period with 5.00 inches reported in Shorewood, 4.90 inches at the National Weather Service office in Romeoville, 4.10 inches in Midlothian, 4.00 inches in Joliet, 3.56 inches in Orland Park, 3.50 inches in Plainfield and South Holland, and 2.05 inches in Plano in Kendall county.  Widespread street flooding was reported across all of north and central Will and southern Cook counties and many homes and businesses suffered water and flood damage.  Retention ponds were flooded and backing up into yards and streets in Plainfield in Will county.  Creeks were overflowing their banks in Midlothian in Cook county.  Several roads had two to four feet of standing water and were impassible, some roads were partially washed away.  Several cars were submerged at the intersection of Lagrange and Nebraska streets in Frankfort in Will county.  A Will county sheriff's car was destroyed when it pulled into a flooded subdivision and sank.  Several people had to be rescued from their cars after becoming trapped by flood waters in Frankfort, Lockport, Joliet, and Plainfield in Will county.  A creek bridge was washed away in Lockport township.  A man indirectly died from the flooding after walking into his flooded basement and being shocked because the water was in contact with electricity.  An alley between Illinois and Main Streets in Lemont in Cook county was partially washed away by fast flowing water.  100 homes and 13 businesses were flooded in Lemont.  Flood waters surrounded several buildings in Tinely Park.  A 15 foot berm was washed away in unicorpated Palos Township which caused massive street and basement flooding in the Sandberg Glen subdivision.

The long lived nature of the tornado was due to it riding along a warm front pushing through Putnam and La Salle counties.  Satellite imagery indicated a strengthening mesocyclone at 1625 CST (2225 Z) with the formation of a new line of feeder clouds into the supercell, and KDVN 88D velocity data showed a strengthening TVS signature by 1635 CST (2235 Z).\\r\\n\\tWitnesses reported a multiple vortex tornado just prior to its arrival in Granville.

The town was bisected by the half mile wide tornado with 12 buildings destroyed, 45 with major damage, and 26 with minor damage (mainly residential).  The Granville State National Bank lost its roof and Hopkins Elementary School lost the roof over the old gymnasium with damage in nearly all the classrooms.

Eight people died and seven were rescued from the basement of a turn of the century sandstone building at Clark and Church Streets. The tornado was approximately 250 yards wide at this point.

The apartment building suffered severe damage and has been deemed uninhabitable.  A farm implement building/business, which was close to 200 feet in length, had roughly three quarters of the building destroyed.  Damage for this building was estimated at nearly $2 million, as several combines inside were severely damaged or destroyed.  Debris from the building was thrown into a nearby power substation, causing a complete power outage to the town of 5,000 residents as well as neighboring communities.  The tornado appeared to have lifted off the ground and stayed at tree top level for the remainder of its life through the town producing F0 damage.  Numerous trees had the tops broken off and several large trees were uprooted.

Numerous cases of missiling were observed, including glass embedded in trees. Tree destruction in forested areas was nearly complete, and a few trees were debarked. The only fatality in Massac County was a 65-year-old female who was killed when her mobile home disintegrated. The official cause of death was blunt trauma to the head. She was found in a water-filled ravine about 100 yards from the former site of her mobile home. The frame of the mobile home was wrapped around the trunks of two trees that were stripped of all their limbs. Most of the levelled frame homes were concentrated on Boaz Road and Rolling Hills Road, in or near Hillerman. After passing through Hillerman, the tornado overturned dozens of railroad cars of a train just west of the Mermet Lake Conservation Area, which is off U.S. Route 45. The Mermet Lake Conservation Area was extensively damaged. An estimated 300 acres of forest were destroyed, boat docks were destroyed, and bathing facilities were destroyed. Dozens of waterfowl were found dead. After destroying additional residences and high tension power lines, the tornado crossed Interstate 24 near mile marker 28, about a mile south of the New Columbia exit. Tractor-trailer rigs and a tour bus were overturned on the interstate, injuring the drivers. The interstate was closed due to grain bins, tree limbs, and some building debris on the highway. Additional residences were destroyed between the interstate and the Pope County line. The tornado crossed into Pope County near where Illinois Route 145 crosses the county line. In Massac County, a total of 15 single-family houses and 13 mobile homes were destroyed. About 20 other single-family houses and 15 mobile homes received major damage. Several dozen other residences had some type of minor damage. Numerous vehicles and farming implements were destroyed, including combines. About 20 persons were injured in Massac County, but only one or two were hospitalized in serious or critical condition.

Approximately three miles northeast of Timewell the tornado damaged another farmstead and numerous trees. Six machine sheds were destroyed while a home sustained damage to the roof and the west and south walls. A number of large trees in the vicinity of the farmstead were also damaged. Five miles northwest of Mount Sterling, several witnesses observed a multiple vortex pattern with several smaller tornadoes rotating around a larger tornado. The width of the damage area (mainly trees) varied from 50 to as large as 300 yards.  Numerous trees were snapped at the base of the tree and tossed northeastward. The damage intensity was estimated from F1 to the lower end of F2. The tornado continued to travel northeast crossing county road 1500 north (5 miles north-northwest of Mount Sterling). Several large trees were either snapped half-way or uprooted at this location. Damage path width ranged from 50 to as large as 100 yards while damage intensity was estimated at the lower end of F1. The tornado damage intensified a second time as the tornado moved across Illinois Highway 99, 7 miles north of Mount Sterling.  One old farm home and a large barn were completely destroyed with debris tossed 1/3 mile to the east.  A second farmstead 1/2 mile east experienced damage to several machine sheds, grain bins and a barn. The nearby home sustained little damage. Several large trees in the vicinity of the barn and machine sheds were uprooted or snapped near the base of the trunk. The width of the damage pattern over this area varied from 50 to 100 yards.

Satellite imagery indicated a strengthening mesocyclone at 1625 CST (2225 Z) with the formation of a new line of feeder clouds into the supercell, and KDVN 88D velocity data showed a strengthening TVS signature by 1635 CST (2235 Z).\\r\\n\\tWitnesses reported a multiple vortex tornado just prior to its arrival in Granville.  The tornado hit Granville at 1647-1648 CST which coincided with the failure of the main power feed into town.  The town was bisected by the half mile wide tornado with 12 buildings destroyed, 45 with major damage, and 26 with minor damage (mainly residential).  The Granville State National Bank lost its roof and Hopkins Elementary School lost the roof over the old gymnasium with damage in nearly all the classrooms.  Significant damage also occurred to Granville Drugs, the only drug store in town.  In a strange twist of irony, the town had finally recovered from a major fire 4 years earlier that decimated much of the business district.  The tornado continued northeast out of Granville and crossed over into La Salle County (WFO LOT) at 1653 CST (2253 Z), 3.8 miles Northeast of Granville.\\r\\n\\tThe Granville/Utica tornado was the first significant test of a new statewide mutual aid response agreement.  In Granville 5 people were injured by the tornado, including an eldery female who suffered a heart attack during the tornado and was eventually Life Flighted to a Peoria hospital.  Injuries were low due to the 32 minutes of lead time before the tornado struck Granville. Damage in Granville is estimated to be at least $8 million with the school suffering at least $3.5 million in damage.\", \"ABSOLUTE_ROWNUMBER\": 263}, {\"EVENT_ID\": 5390599, \"CZ_NAME_STR\": \"LA SALLE CO.\", \"BEGIN_LOCATION\": \"PERU\", \"BEGIN_DATE\": \"4/20/2004\", \"BEGIN_TIME\": 1653, \"EVENT_TYPE\": \"Tornado\", \"MAGNITUDE\": \" \", \"TOR_F_SCALE\": 3, \"DEATHS_DIRECT\": 8, \"INJURIES_DIRECT\": 7, \"DAMAGE_PROPERTY_NUM\": 0, \"DAMAGE_CROPS_NUM\": 0, \"STATE_ABBR\": \"IL\", \"CZ_TIMEZONE\": \"CST\", \"MAGNITUDE_TYPE\": \" \", \"EPISODE_ID\": 1167729, \"CZ_TYPE\": \"C\", \"CZ_FIPS\": 99, \"WFO\": \"LOT\", \"INJURIES_INDIRECT\": 0, \"DEATHS_INDIRECT\": 0, \"SOURCE\": \"NWS STORM SURVEY\", \"FLOOD_CAUSE\": \" \", \"TOR_LENGTH\": 9.0, \"TOR_WIDTH\": 250, \"BEGIN_RANGE\": \"3\", \"BEGIN_AZIMUTH\": \"SW\", \"END_RANGE\": \"3\", \"END_AZIMUTH\": \"SW\", \"END_LOCATION\": \"PERU\", \"END_DATE\": \"4/20/2004\", \"END_TIME\": 1709, \"BEGIN_LAT\": 41.3, \"BEGIN_LON\": -89.18333, \"END_LAT\": 41.33333, \"END_LON\": -89.01667, \"EVENT_NARRATIVE\": \"The tornado entered LaSalle County from Putnam County, approximately 3 miles northeast of the town of Standard, producing F0 intensity damage in a wooded area southwest of Peru.  As the tornado continued northeast, F2 intensity damage was done to several homes in a subdivision near the intersection of East 250th and 2569th Roads.  Several roofs were blown off homes along with damage to external walls.  Significant tree damage was done as well.  Path width was estimated at 50 yards at this location.  The tornado then continued northeast, crossing the Illinois River twice as it moved toward the town of Utica, downing a steel high tension tower on the north bank of the river, immediately west of Illinois 251.  The tornado moved into the southwest side of Utica where it was F0 intensity. Homes along Washington Street only had tree and minor roof damage. A church steeple was damaged on Division between Johnson and Washington. Roofs and trees were more severely damaged on the south side of Johnson Street. The tornado rapidly increased to F3 intensity on the north side of Johnson Street where one home had its roof taken off and north walls blown out. A machinery building was completely destroyed on the south side of the canal and a semi-tractor trailer was blown into the canal. A large grain bin was blown across the canal and flattened. The tornado then moved north of the canal into the heart of town where several homes were severely damaged, garages were destroyed and brick buildings collapsed. Eight people died and seven were rescued from the basement of a turn of the century sandstone building at Clark and Church Streets. The tornado was approximately 250 yards wide at this point. On the east edge of the vortex along Mill Street, in downtown, buildings suffered damage to facades, roofs and windows. East of Mill Street there was damage to trees and minor roof damage. In the northeast section of town a mobile home was overturned on Grove, just east of Mill Street. The vortex crossed the railroad tracks and apparently dissipated on a steep bluff on the northeast side of town. At the top of the hill there were some trees and limbs down and some debris deposited.  \\r\\n\\r\\nSee Storm Data for Northwest and Central Illinois for results of Tornado Damage Survey for Putnam and Bureau Counties, IL\", \"EPISODE_NARRATIVE\": null, \"ABSOLUTE_ROWNUMBER\": 264}, {\"EVENT_ID\": 5390600, \"CZ_NAME_STR\": \"LA SALLE CO.\", \"BEGIN_LOCATION\": \"UTICA\", \"BEGIN_DATE\": \"4/20/2004\", \"BEGIN_TIME\": 1710, \"EVENT_TYPE\": \"Tornado\", \"MAGNITUDE\": \" \", \"TOR_F_SCALE\": 2, \"DEATHS_DIRECT\": 0, \"INJURIES_DIRECT\": 0, \"DAMAGE_PROPERTY_NUM\": 0, \"DAMAGE_CROPS_NUM\": 0, \"STATE_ABBR\": \"IL\", \"CZ_TIMEZONE\": \"CST\", \"MAGNITUDE_TYPE\": \" \", \"EPISODE_ID\": 1167729, \"CZ_TYPE\": \"C\", \"CZ_FIPS\": 99, \"WFO\": \"LOT\", \"INJURIES_INDIRECT\": 0, \"DEATHS_INDIRECT\": 0, \"SOURCE\": \"NWS STORM SURVEY\", \"FLOOD_CAUSE\": \" \", \"TOR_LENGTH\": 9.0, \"TOR_WIDTH\": 400, \"BEGIN_RANGE\": \"2\", \"BEGIN_AZIMUTH\": \"NE\", \"END_RANGE\": \"2\", \"END_AZIMUTH\": \"NE\", \"END_LOCATION\": \"UTICA\", \"END_DATE\": \"4/20/2004\", \"END_TIME\": 1727, \"BEGIN_LAT\": 41.35, \"BEGIN_LON\": -89.0, \"END_LAT\": 41.4, \"END_LON\": -88.85, \"EVENT_NARRATIVE\": \"The tornado formed on the ridge northeast of Utica and moved across County Road 2803, west of 10th Street.

Steel beams and metal siding from the plant were found approximately three quarters of a mile east in a farm field. \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the plant, the tornado continued east, just south of Illinois Route 116/117, affecting 4 farmsteads approximately 1/2 to 1 mile east of the plant.  Two of the farmsteads closest to the plant (about 1/2 to 3/4 mile east) had the 2-story houses completely blown away, with only debris remaining in the basements and nearby property.  The other two farmsteads had significant damage to the 2-story houses with outbuildings demolished.  The center of the tornado tracked about 100 yards south of the houses located on the south side of the road.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the plant to the farmsteads, the average width of the tornado was 400 yards and was close to 1/4 mile wide at times.  The greatest tornado intensity was during this approximately 1 mile stretch and has been rated F4 by the National Weather Service.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this point, the tornado began to move more east-southeast and caused significant damage to a barn near the intersection of County Roads 1300N and 1600E, about 2.5 miles southwest of Roanoke. The tornado continued to move east-southeast and damaged a house about 1.25 miles south-southwest of Roanoke, near the intersection of County Roads 1300N and 1700E.  The tornado crossed 1300N shortly afterward and curved sharply to the southeast. The tornado lifted around 254 pm about 2 miles southeast of Roanoke, at County Road 1900E.\", \"EPISODE_NARRATIVE\": null, \"ABSOLUTE_ROWNUMBER\": 330}, {\"EVENT_ID\": 5412046, \"CZ_NAME_STR\": \"MCLEAN CO.\", \"BEGIN_LOCATION\": \"NORMAL\", \"BEGIN_DATE\": \"7/13/2004\", \"BEGIN_TIME\": 1352, \"EVENT_TYPE\": \"Tornado\", \"MAGNITUDE\": \" \", \"TOR_F_SCALE\": 0, \"DEATHS_DIRECT\": 0, \"INJURIES_DIRECT\": 0, \"DAMAGE_PROPERTY_NUM\": 0, \"DAMAGE_CROPS_NUM\": 0, \"STATE_ABBR\": \"IL\", \"CZ_TIMEZONE\": \"CST\", \"MAGNITUDE_TYPE\": \" \", \"EPISODE_ID\": 1176048, \"CZ_TYPE\": \"C\", \"CZ_FIPS\": 113, \"WFO\": \"ILX\", \"INJURIES_INDIRECT\": 0, \"DEATHS_INDIRECT\": 0, \"SOURCE\": \"LAW ENFORCEMENT\", \"FLOOD_CAUSE\": \" \", \"TOR_LENGTH\": 0.1, \"TOR_WIDTH\": 10, \"BEGIN_RANGE\": \"8\", \"BEGIN_AZIMUTH\": \"N\", \"END_RANGE\": \"8\", \"END_AZIMUTH\": \"N\", \"END_LOCATION\": \"NORMAL\", \"END_DATE\": \"7/13/2004\", \"END_TIME\": 1352, \"BEGIN_LAT\": 40.63333, \"BEGIN_LON\": -89.0, \"END_LAT\": 40.63333, \"END_LON\": -89.0, \"EVENT_NARRATIVE\": \"A tornado briefly touched down in a field.
