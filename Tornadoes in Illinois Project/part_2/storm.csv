The son received broken bones. Their house was impaled by some nearby large trees that prevented it from being swept farther away.

Estimated winds of 210 MPH disintegrated mobile homes and levelled several modern frame homes. One frame house was swept clean off its foundation, with only the roof left intact in a creek about 200 yards away. Many vehicles were lifted, rolled, or thrown up to 100 yards or more. Numerous cases of missiling were observed, including glass embedded in trees. Tree destruction in forested areas was nearly complete, and a few trees were debarked. The only fatality in Massac County was a 65-year-old female who was killed when her mobile home disintegrated. The official cause of death was blunt trauma to the head. She was found in a water-filled ravine about 100 yards from the former site of her mobile home. The frame of the mobile home was wrapped around the trunks of two trees that were stripped of all their limbs. Most of the levelled frame homes were concentrated on Boaz Road and Rolling Hills Road, in or near Hillerman. After passing through Hillerman, the tornado overturned dozens of railroad cars of a train just west of the Mermet Lake Conservation Area, which is off U.S. Route 45. The Mermet Lake Conservation Area was extensively damaged. An estimated 300 acres of forest were destroyed, boat docks were destroyed, and bathing facilities were destroyed. Dozens of waterfowl were found dead. After destroying additional residences and high tension power lines, the tornado crossed Interstate 24 near mile marker 28, about a mile south of the New Columbia exit. Tractor-trailer rigs and a tour bus were overturned on the interstate, injuring the drivers. The interstate was closed due to grain bins, tree limbs, and some building debris on the highway. Additional residences were destroyed between the interstate and the Pope County line. The tornado crossed into Pope County near where Illinois Route 145 crosses the county line. In Massac County, a total of 15 single-family houses and 13 mobile homes were destroyed. About 20 other single-family houses and 15 mobile homes received major damage. Several dozen other residences had some type of minor damage. Numerous vehicles and farming implements were destroyed, including combines. About 20 persons were injured in Massac County, but only one or two were hospitalized in serious or critical condition. Most of the injuries involved lacerations, bruises, broken bones, and internal injuries.

An additional nine single-family homes and two mobile homes received major damage. Dozens of other residences received minor to moderate damage. Some vehicles were rolled or moved. The tornado passed just west and northwest of Golconda before ending about a mile north of town. Just west of Golconda, the roof was blown off the county elementary school's gymnasium.  Despite the seven destroyed residences, not one injury was reported. The maximum intensity of the tornado was rated F-3 in Pope County, and F-4 in Massac and Pulaski Counties. The slightly lower intensity of the tornado, combined with the fact it narrowly missed the center of several Pope County communities, may partly explain the lack of injuries.

The damage intensity was estimated from F1 to the lower end of F2. The tornado continued to travel northeast crossing county road 1500 north (5 miles north-northwest of Mount Sterling). Several large trees were either snapped half-way or uprooted at this location. Damage path width ranged from 50 to as large as 100 yards while damage intensity was estimated at the lower end of F1.

The deadliest and longest lived tornado started at 1644 CST, 0.7 miles North Northeast of Florid in Putnam County and moved northeast toward Granville.  The long lived nature of the tornado was due to it riding along a warm front pushing through Putnam and La Salle counties.  Satellite imagery indicated a strengthening mesocyclone at 1625 CST (2225 Z) with the formation of a new line of feeder clouds into the supercell, and KDVN 88D velocity data showed a strengthening TVS signature by 1635 CST (2235 Z).

The tornado traveled southeast for about 2.5 miles, before beginning a temporary eastward jog between county roads 1300E and 1400E. The tornado curved southeast again, striking the Parsons Company, Inc.'s manufacturing plant around 241 pm CDT.  The plant was severely damaged by the tornado.  Approximately 140 people were in the plant at the time, but all personnel made it to storm shelters in time (approximately 3 to 5 minutes before the tornado arrived).  Steel beams and metal siding from the plant were found approximately three quarters of a mile east in a farm field. 

From the plant, the tornado continued east, just south of Illinois Route 116/117, affecting 4 farmsteads approximately 1/2 to 1 mile east of the plant.  Two of the farmsteads closest to the plant (about 1/2 to 3/4 mile east) had the 2-story houses completely blown away, with only debris remaining in the basements and nearby property.  The other two farmsteads had significant damage to the 2-story houses with outbuildings demolished.  The center of the tornado tracked about 100 yards south of the houses located on the south side of the road.

From the plant to the farmsteads, the average width of the tornado was 400 yards and was close to 1/4 mile wide at times.  The greatest tornado intensity was during this approximately 1 mile stretch and has been rated F4 by the National Weather Service.

At this point, the tornado began to move more east-southeast and caused significant damage to a barn near the intersection of County Roads 1300N and 1600E, about 2.5 miles southwest of Roanoke. The tornado continued to move east-southeast and damaged a house about 1.25 miles south-southwest of Roanoke, near the intersection of County Roads 1300N and 1700E.
