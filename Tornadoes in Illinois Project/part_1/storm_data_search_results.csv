A 53-year-old man was killed when the chimney of his house collapsed on him. The man, who was in his basement, was protecting his son by lying on top of him when the collapse occurred. The son received broken bones. Their house was impaled by some nearby large trees that prevented it from being swept farther away. Along the Pulaski County portion of the tornado path, six single family homes and ten mobile homes were destroyed. Another ten single family homes and a mobile home had major damage. A few dozen other residences received some type of minor damage. A few dozen outbuildings, two businesses, and a campground were destroyed or had major damage.

Estimated winds of 210 MPH disintegrated mobile homes and levelled several modern frame homes. One frame house was swept clean off its foundation, with only the roof left intact in a creek about 200 yards away. Many vehicles were lifted, rolled, or thrown up to 100 yards or more. Numerous cases of missiling were observed, including glass embedded in trees. Tree destruction in forested areas was nearly complete, and a few trees were debarked. The only fatality in Massac County was a 65-year-old female who was killed when her mobile home disintegrated. The official cause of death was blunt trauma to the head. She was found in a water-filled ravine about 100 yards from the former site of her mobile home. The frame of the mobile home was wrapped around the trunks of two trees that were stripped of all their limbs. Most of the levelled frame homes were concentrated on Boaz Road and Rolling Hills Road, in or near Hillerman. After passing through Hillerman, the tornado overturned dozens of railroad cars of a train just west of the Mermet Lake Conservation Area, which is off U.S. Route 45. The Mermet Lake Conservation Area was extensively damaged. An estimated 300 acres of forest were destroyed, boat docks were destroyed, and bathing facilities were destroyed. Dozens of waterfowl were found dead. After destroying additional residences and high tension power lines, the tornado crossed Interstate 24 near mile marker 28, about a mile south of the New Columbia exit. Tractor-trailer rigs and a tour bus were overturned on the interstate, injuring the drivers. The interstate was closed due to grain bins, tree limbs, and some building debris on the highway. Additional residences were destroyed between the interstate and the Pope County line. The tornado crossed into Pope County near where Illinois Route 145 crosses the county line. In Massac County, a total of 15 single-family houses and 13 mobile homes were destroyed. About 20 other single-family houses and 15 mobile homes received major damage. Several dozen other residences had some type of minor damage. Numerous vehicles and farming implements were destroyed, including combines. About 20 persons were injured in Massac County, but only one or two were hospitalized in serious or critical condition. Most of the injuries involved lacerations, bruises, broken bones, and internal injuries.

An additional nine single-family homes and two mobile homes received major damage. Dozens of other residences received minor to moderate damage. Some vehicles were rolled or moved. The tornado passed just west and northwest of Golconda before ending about a mile north of town. Just west of Golconda, the roof was blown off the county elementary school's gymnasium.  Despite the seven destroyed residences, not one injury was reported. The maximum intensity of the tornado was rated F-3 in Pope County, and F-4 in Massac and Pulaski Counties. The slightly lower intensity of the tornado, combined with the fact it narrowly missed the center of several Pope County communities, may partly explain the lack of injuries.

The main line of thunderstorms had already moved east of the area when a small thunderstorm developed near Yorkville and quickly interacted with a lake breeze moving west through the same area.  This interaction helped to form a circulation which spun up as a weak tornado.  Numerous trees were damaged and some were blown down.  Damage occurred to several trailers and campers from the falling trees and tree limbs.  The tornado appeared to skip along the ground with the strongest winds staying aloft affecting mainly the trees.  The tornado lasted about two minutes.,"A line of severe thunderstorms moved east across north central Illinois during the early afternoon hours of July 27th.  Additional thunderstorms developed ahead of the first line across the southern portions of the Chicago Metro area producing very heavy rain and widespread flooding.  As the first line of severe storms reached Lee county, numerous trees, tree limbs and power lines were blown down in Amboy in Lee county.  Trees were blown down onto houses in West Brooklyn, also in Lee county.  Winds as high as 65 mph blew down trees, large tree limbs and power lines across many locations in La Salle county.  Trees were blown down in La Salle.  Trees were uprooted near Lake Holiday in far northeast La Salle county.  Large tree limbs were blown down in Mendota, Norway and one mile east of Serena.  A grain bin was crushed and partially lifted off its base in Ottawa and a tree fell onto a car in Seatonville, both in LaSalle county.  Wind damage was widespread across Kendall county as well.  Trees, large tree limbs and power lines were blown down in Plano, Newark and Oswego as well as many rural parts of the county.  Trees were blown down blocking Illinois Route 71 west of Oswego.  Trees 20 inches in diameter were blown down southeast of Plano along Lynwood Drive.  Southwest of Plano, a large tree limb fell onto a roof and broke a skylight.  Winds gusted to 74 mph in Sandwich in De Kalb county, where numerous large trees were blown down or uprooted and a 20 inch diameter tree fell onto house.  Several trees and tents were blown down at an Antique show in Sandwich in DeKlab county where one person suffered a broken arm and another was hit in the head by a falling tent pole.  Canopies were also blown off of stores in Sandwich.  A two and a half foot diameter tree was snapped at its base in Morris in Grundy county.  A gust to 60 mph was reported in Naperville in Will county.  A one foot diameter tree was snapped in half on Winthrop Street, east of Larkin and north of Black Roads in Joliet.  Large tree limbs and power lines were blown down in Kankakee.  A tree fell onto power lines in Sheldon in Iroquois county.

In addition to the strong winds and wind damage, very heavy rain fell across much of Will and southern Cook counties.

Widespread street flooding was reported across all of north and central Will and southern Cook counties and many homes and businesses suffered water and flood damage.  Retention ponds were flooded and backing up into yards and streets in Plainfield in Will county.  Creeks were overflowing their banks in Midlothian in Cook county.  Several roads had two to four feet of standing water and were impassible, some roads were partially washed away.  Several cars were submerged at the intersection of Lagrange and Nebraska streets in Frankfort in Will county.  A Will county sheriff's car was destroyed when it pulled into a flooded subdivision and sank.  Several people had to be rescued from their cars after becoming trapped by flood waters in Frankfort, Lockport, Joliet, and Plainfield in Will county.  A creek bridge was washed away in Lockport township.  A man indirectly died from the flooding after walking into his flooded basement and being shocked because the water was in contact with electricity.  An alley between Illinois and Main Streets in Lemont in Cook county was partially washed away by fast flowing water.  100 homes and 13 businesses were flooded in Lemont.  Flood waters surrounded several buildings in Tinely Park.  A 15 foot berm was washed away in unicorpated Palos Township which caused massive street and basement flooding in the Sandberg Glen subdivision.

The deadliest and longest lived tornado started at 1644 CST, 0.7 miles North Northeast of Florid in Putnam County and moved northeast toward Granville.  The long lived nature of the tornado was due to it riding along a warm front pushing through Putnam and La Salle counties.  Satellite imagery indicated a strengthening mesocyclone at 1625 CST (2225 Z) with the formation of a new line of feeder clouds into the supercell, and KDVN 88D velocity data showed a strengthening TVS signature by 1635 CST (2235 Z).
	Witnesses reported a multiple vortex tornado just prior to its arrival in Granville.  The tornado hit Granville at 1647-1648 CST which coincided with the failure of the main power feed into town.

The tornado moved into the southwest side of Utica where it was F0 intensity. Homes along Washington Street only had tree and minor roof damage. A church steeple was damaged on Division between Johnson and Washington. Roofs and trees were more severely damaged on the south side of Johnson Street.
